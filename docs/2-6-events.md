## Precondition

Make sure you
1. are [logged in](2-1-login.md).
1. are aware of the different 
[content types](1-2-terms.md#content-types).
1. know how to [save changes](2-2-front.md#saving-changes).

## Editing or adding an event

This works similar as for posts and pages: In the [backend](1-2-terms
.md#backend) go to _Events_ then click _Add New_ or hover over the event you 
want to edit and click _Edit_.

Other than for posts and pages, the image is only displayed in the teaser. 
But it is mandatory (else the design looks really bad).
