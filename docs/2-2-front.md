## Precondition

Make sure you're [logged in](2-1-login.md).


## How to get to the edit screen

There are mainly two ways:
1. Go to the front page (on the [frontend](1-2-terms.md#frontend)) and click 
the _edit page_ button.

1. Go to _Pages_, hover the mouse pointer over the front page and click the 
_Edit_ link.

## You'll master it

The front page is the most advanced page to edit. Once you master it, editing 
other pages is peanuts üòÅ. And even the front page isn't that complicated!


## The main campaign

This is the main content block with the images the bars etc.

Just play around with the main campaign elements in the 
[edit mode](#how-to-get-to-the-edit-screen) of the front page and you'll find
out how it works.

### Campaign Summary
The main idea of the campaign summary is, to provide the reader with your 
main mission in very few words. If you need more space, you can create a 
dedicated page and link it to the campaign summary using the _Read more 
button_. For now, just keep it short. Once you know more about pages, adding
the link is intuitive.

### Call to Action
The call to action section is designed to easily involve your visitors. 
Add a form with a very low level involvement, like one to subscribe to your 
newsletter. See the [forms chapter](2-7-form.md) on how to create new forms.


## Saving changes

This may take a few seconds. Wait until the page reloads.

## The content blocks

All other content on the front page, is to be added and edited in the _Content
Blocks_ section. Content blocks can be positioned in any order and you are 
free to add any type of block.

Every content block has a _Block Title_. The block title refers to this:

You can link the block title to an [archive](1-2-terms.md#archives) 
(category), any page, post or event on this website (internal), an external URL
or simply don't link it at all (none).


### Positions

Use the positions block to present your political views to the visitors with 
a few keywords. If you want to tell more about it, you are free to create a 
page for every position block and add it as read more target.

### Events

The events block displays your upcoming events. To create events, see the 
[events chapter](2-6-events.md).

### Testimonials

Present your supporters using a testimonials block. You must add the 
testimonials in the [people section](3-1-people.md) first.

### Single Post / Page Teaser

If you want to feature a special page or post on your front page, use this 
block. Create the [page](2-3-page.md) or [post](2-4-post.md) first. This block
can be added multiple times.

### Double Post / Page Teaser

This works analogous to the 
[Single Post / Page Teaser](#single-post-page-teaser) but shows two teasers 
at once.

### Latest Press Release

This block is especially designed for party websites. You can configure 
this block, to always display the newest [post](2-4-post.md) of a 
certain category (provided the posts were created with the 
[_Press Release_ template](2-4-post.md#template)). If the given 
post contains a quote, the quote will be displayed instead of the lead.

### Vote Recommendations

This block is especially designed for party websites. Place it close to the top.
The main goal is, to provide all your vote recommendations at single a glance.
You should link either a post where you explain your position in detail, or a
link to an external source, like a committee, where a votes can gather more 
information.

### Map Block

This is advanced. If you know enough to use it, you most probably don't need
this manual üòâ


## Search engines and social media
We use the excellent third party plugin 
[Yoast SEO](https://yoast.com/wordpress-seo/) for search engine optimization and
to generate meta information for social media. It you want to know more, here is
a great [documentation](https://yoast.com/wordpress-seo/) from the vendor 
itself. However there is one very important thing, that you have to care 
about: The preview text of the front page for social media and search 
engines must be edited manually (on all other pages this goes automatically).

![Screenshot](assets/yoast.png)
Scroll to the bottom of the edit page, then click on the preview text in the 
Yoast SEO metabox. A text field appears below. Enter your preview text here.

If you want to test how you site looks on facebook, if someone shares it, use
the [facebook debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/). 
Enter your URL and hit _Debug_. Since facebook caches things you might have 
to click _Fetch new scrape information_ twice.
