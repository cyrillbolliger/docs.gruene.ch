## About this documentation

This guide is intended to help you maintain your own website. It assumes that
you have a fully configured website, as we 
[offer](https://extern18.gruene.ch/musterperson/angebot) it. The manual is to 
be understood more as a starting aid and does not claim to explain the 
used system, WordPress, in detail. WordPress, however, has a clear design 
and it's well translated. To get started, it's best to simply play with the 
different functions and you will soon be familiar with WordPress. **Trying it 
out is the be-all and end-all, you can't break anything.**

For the sake of fairness all screenshots in this documentation are neither 
german nor french, they are simply in english â€“ even tough your installation 
will be well translated into the language of your preference.
   
## WordPress is well documented online

**If you get stuck, a Google search is recommended in any case.** WordPress is so 
widespread that almost every question is answered by a small tutorial or a 
forum post. If you don't find what you're looking for on Google, we'll be 
happy to help. Just Email us ðŸ˜‰

Now we wish you a lot of fun and success.
