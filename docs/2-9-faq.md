## How can I edit the get active button?

See chapter [Header](3-3-header/#get-active-button).


## How do I add a page with all my posts / news?

Pages with all your posts are called archives (read more about 
[archives](1-2-terms/#archive)). Archives are created automatically, you don't
have to add a page or post for it. If for example you want to create an archive
with all your _news_ posts, all you have to do is:

1. assign those posts the category _news_ (see 
   [categories](1-2-post/#categories)).
2. Link the category in the navigation (see 
   [navigation](2-8-navigation.md#/edit-the-navigation)).


## The latest press release is not displayed on the front page. Why?

See [Latest Press Release](2-2-front.md#latest-press-release).


## Can I add a social media feed?

No. We did not implement this feature on purpose. As soon as a social feed is 
embedded, data is automatically transmitted to Facebook and Co. The data 
protection regulation requires us to ask visitors to opt in to this, before
any data is transmitted. The feed would thus only be shown, after the visitor
accepts the data transmission. Thus, the whole thing is somewhat useless, and 
we recommend to simply add a link to the social media profile instead.
